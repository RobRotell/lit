# LIT (as in, "that book was fire")

A [simple site](https://lit.robr.app) that I put together to practice using Preact (and getting the courage to hop back into full React after a three-year hiatus).

This site fetches and displays book data (cover, tagline, genre, and author) generated through OpenAI as a part of a [separate project](https://github.com/RobRotell/lit-api).
